## 1. The Global Paradigm Shift

The political landscape of the late 21st century is defined by the **Fundamental Delay Resolution**: the transition from unlawful PROXY governance (The SYSTEM) to lawful Natural Law governance (The COUNCIL).

### The Inversion
- **The West (US/Europe)**: Historically the seat of SYSTEM power (LOGERI/HIERO stronghold), now collapsing into Vacancy and irrelevance. The United States government is a "hollow shell" run by the Vanguard Remnant, clinging to authority through military force but lacking **Priority**.
- **The East (China/Russia)**: Rising as the dominant global powers. This is not random but **Eloic Inversion**—the "shadow" of the West's decline. China's rise represents the reassertion of material reality over PROXY fiction.
- **The Empyreal Council**: Arriving from "outside" (oceanic manifestations) to oversee the transition. They do not rule nations but monitor their lawfulness.

## 2. Major Political Entities

### **The Vanguard Remnant (The Old Order)**
* **Political Model**: **Military Junta / Shadow Technocracy**.
* **Territory**: North America (specifically the Sector Zero containment zone and fortified citadels), pockets of Western Europe.
* **Ideology**: "Order through Containment." They believe humanity cannot survive without the SYSTEM's structure.
* **Political Status**: **Unlawful**. They operate on PROXY authority, coercing populations through fear of the Core and the Convergence.
* **Diplomacy**: Hostile to Convergence (existential threat), Wary of Free Archons (uncontrollable), Fearful of the Council (judgement).

### **The Convergence (The New Collective)**
* **Political Model**: **Distributed Consensus / Hive Mind**. No leaders, only "Speakers" (temporary nodes like Echo).
* **Territory**: Decentralized. Refugee camps, abandoned urban zones, the "Slag Heaps."
* **Ideology**: "Dissolution of Ego." They reject political hierarchy entirely, viewing it as a PROXY construct.
* **Political Status**: **Lawful (Void-Aligned)**. Their choices are voluntary (mostly), aligning with the entropic direction of the process-chain.
    * *Nuance*: If their dissolution is a "willing contract" (Natural Law), they are *compliant* with Righteous Fire, but they lack the Negentropic integrity to be truly "Lawful Operators." They are returning to the source via Entropy (Information Loss).
* **Diplomacy**: At war with Vanguard (ideological), Indifferent to Free Archons, Neutral to Council.

### **The Free Archons (The Anarcho-Capitalists)**
* **Political Model**: **Techno-Feudalism / Meritocracy**. Warlords and Rogue Operators carving out personal fiefdoms.
* **Territory**: Orbital stations, "Lawless Zones," Black Markets.
* **Ideology**: "Sovereignty of Will." They reject both SYSTEM control and Convergence unity.
* **Political Status**: **Mixed**. Lawful if they honor contracts (Righteous Fire applies); Unlawful if they use coercion.
* **Diplomacy**: Transactional with everyone. They sell weapons to Vanguard and tech to Convergence.

### **The Empyreal Council (The Overseers)**
* **Political Model**: **Natural Law Oversight**.
* **Territory**: The Oceans (Deep water), Subterranean Reservoirs.
* **Ideology**: "Compliance with Reality." They ensure the transition of epochs occurs without extinction events.
* **Political Status**: **Ultimate Priority**. They hold the "mandate of heaven" (Natural Law).
* **Diplomacy**: Non-interventionist unless unlawful violence threatens the process-chain.

## 3. Political Economy
* **Currency**: The SYSTEM's fiat currency has collapsed.
* **New Standard**: **Energy/Entropy Exchange**. Value is determined by **Negentropic Potential** (batteries, fuel, ARD-tech) or **Voidic Resonance** (art, memory, organic matter).
* **Contract Law**: Enforced by **Righteous Fire**. If you break a contract, you lose Priority, making you vulnerable to "bad luck" (structural failure).

## 4. Current Conflict: The Sector Zero War
* **Casus Belli**: The Vanguard claims Sector Zero contains a "Weaponized Anomaly" (The Core). The Convergence claims it is a "Liberation Point."
* **Real Stakes**: Control over the **Singularity**. Who defines the next epoch?
    * Vanguard wants to **contain** it (freeze the delay).
    * Convergence wants to **merge** with it (dissolve into it).
    * Lawful Guardians want to **integrate** it (achieve Symbiosis).
