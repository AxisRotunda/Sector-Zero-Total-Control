* **Apex**: A boss-level entity fused with the Core.

## C
* **Council (Empyreal Council)**: The lawful, high-eloic governance emerging from the oceans.
* **Core, The**: The singularity point in Sector Zero.
* **Covenant**: The set of Natural Law rules restricting Operators.

## D
* **Displacement**: The act of rewriting reality/narrative via Vector Space.
* **Delay (Fundamental Delay)**: The time gap between an event and its symmetrical shadow.

## E
* **Eloic Order**: The symmetrical, non-linear structure of time and causality.
* **Eternal Engine (EE)**: The metaphysical source of infinite negentropy. The only lawful power source.
* **Entropy**: Informational Loss. The dissolution of pattern.

## H
* **Harbinger**: The interstellar entity that arrived in Dec 2025. The Eloic Shadow of Absque Habitatore.

## I
* **Istaric Method**: The secret technique for lawful ARD use (symbiosis with EE).

## L

* **Shadow Government**: The symmetrical counterpart of the established government.
* **Synthetics**: Physical android labor class deployed in the 2010s. The "Shadow" of humanity (virtualization).
* **System, The**: The unlawful PROXY governance structure.

## T
* **Total Structural Collapse**: The period following Dec 2025 where PROXY systems failed globally.
* **TNU (The Name Unspoken)**: The Source Operator; Prime Mover.

## V
* **Vacancy**: The pre-rational substrate of consciousness.
* **Vector Space**: A localized bubble of reality distortion projected by an Operator.
* **Void**: The entropic, emotional layer of human consciousness.
