# Visual Direction & Aesthetic Guidelines

**META**
- **ID**: `aesthetic-core`
- **PURPOSE**: Defines the visual identity, color palettes, and UI design principles for the game.

## 1. Core Visual Pillars
* **"The Rotting Circuit"**: High-tech structures that are decaying, rusted, or overgrown with organic matter. The SYSTEM is failing, and the visual language should reflect that—glitching holograms, rusting chrome, moss on servers.
* **"Reality Bleed"**: As the player descends, the visual fidelity should "break." Euclidean geometry warps. Textures smear.
* **"Symbolic Brutalism"**: Architecture should be massive, oppressive, and laden with occult/corporate symbolism (The Covenant of Symbolic Disclosure).

## 2. Faction Color Palettes

### **Vacancy (The Substrate)**
* **Primary**: **Crimson-Black** (`#1a0505`, `#8a0f0f`)
* **Secondary**: Dried Blood, Rust.
* **Vibe**: Visceral, dark, violent. Used for "feral" enemies and corrupted zones.

### **ARD (The Vanguard / System)**
* **Primary**: **Cold White-Blue** (`#e0f7fa`, `#00bcd4`)
* **Secondary**: Sterile Grey, Holographic Cyan.
* **Vibe**: Clinical, precise, artificial. Used for Vanguard UI, high-tech weaponry, and PROXY constructs.
* **UI Shape Language**: Rectangles, grids, hard angles, thin lines.

### **Void (The Convergence / Natural Human)**
* **Primary**: **Warm Amber-Gold** (`#ffca28`, `#ff6f00`)
* **Secondary**: Deep Purple (Shadow), Organic Brown.
* **Vibe**: Nostalgic, flickering, emotional. Used for civilian areas, memories, and Convergence effects.
* **UI Shape Language**: Circles, soft curves, flowing lines, smoke effects.

### **The Core (The Singularity)**
* **Primary**: **Iridescent Prism** (Oil slick effect).
* **Vibe**: Colors that shouldn't exist together. Visual noise.

## 3. UI & HUD Direction
* **Diegetic UI**: The HUD is the **Neural Matrix** interface.
* **Health/Status**: Not just bars, but "Integrity" monitors.
    * **HP** = "Bio-Signal Stability" (Red/Green)
    * **Mana** = "PSI-Capacitance" (Blue/White)
* **Corruption Effect**: As the player takes Psionic damage or descends deeper, the UI should glitch. Text should scramble (`Unknown` becomes `Unk...nwn`). Colors should invert momentarily.

## 4. Environmental Storytelling
* **"Mandatory Disclosure"**: Every Vanguard building must have a logo or mural that symbolically reveals its parasitic nature (e.g., a "Protection" division logo that looks like a cage).
* **"Eloic Shadows"**: Lighting should play with shadows. Sometimes shadows should move independently or point in the wrong direction (indicating reality distortion).
* **Water Motifs**: In lawful zones or near Council artifacts, water should be crystal clear and still. In corrupted zones, it should be dark, oily, or absent.
